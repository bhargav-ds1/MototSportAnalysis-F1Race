BLM is an Evil Anarchist organisation whose primary aims are to Defund the Police, Abolish Prisons and release all Inmates and endeavor to topple 'Capitalism' and that's just the start. In the meantime Lewis can isolate in Switzerland, Monaco or many other locations, although no doubt states Monaco as his principal residence as totally TAX FREE. Note pays not a single penny in UK Tax where he grew up and offered him this great opportunity. Current Worth at least $285 Million in spite of spending many Millions on properties around the World.

139,"something about F1 racing just doesn't seem fair.

Why are the mercades cars so much faster (powerful).

And does anyone notice how many ""coincidences"" there are.... like both of ferarri's wheels going out like that at the same time. I've seen this happen with engine parts multiple times....

Is it just more likely that the issue that happens on a car will happen on a like car? Is it cuz the team works on both cars and fucked the same thing up in each due to doing exactly the same to both!?

Why do certain teams at the top never seem to have these issues like others do."

If he was able to do that in a car other than that of the top teams then it would've been commendable. Put him in a Mclaren and then see if recovers those positions or not.

173,omg the cars look so much different now without the halo
174,@Nixer Doyle I do agree. My additional comment was simply an Asterix for whoever may have believed it to be an issue.
175,"@Chris K In three seasons the _one_ potentially reasonable criticism of the halo before its introduction -- impeding driver visibility -- has not once been reported. And it's saved at least one life, for sure. No halo and RoGro would've been killed. It's highly likely that if it hadn't been for the halo, Charles at Spa in 2018 would have suffered life-changing injuries at the very least."
176,"Grosjean would not survive in Bahrain, if there was no Halo..."
177,I might be the odd one out but I actually love the accent the halo adds to the car. It's unfortunate that it hampers the visibility though but the safety benefits are undoubtedly important.

288,"Vettel:
50% Waving hands
49% Bitching and swearing
1% Ping Pong"
289,Verstappen was what ultimately killed Vettel's chances of getting close to Hamilton in the race. That overtake wrecked Ferrari's strategy and led to a load of events culminating in excessive tyre wear and that blow out.
290,"LOL.
When Lewis gets old, he will be one of those old guys who says 'God bless you' at the end of every sentence."
291,"Ferrari started the season well, but they have clearly been out-developed by mercedes. It seems clear to me now that mercedes has the better car, seeing how they have won three of the last four races and have 8 of the 10 pole positions this year. You cant hide anything in quali, thats what shows the pace of mercedes. Hopefully ferrari can come back the second half of the season cuz id like to see someone other than mercedes win the championship again."
292,"...and he is... The Most Aggressive Driver in the World! Bottas that is - drove the tires right off the Ferrari's.
We were told this new season with the new tires and faster {electric} drive would be exciting and it sure is! A bouncy bumpy ride."

294,VETTEL THE BEST IDIOT EVER.
295,"Those who said that ham out qualified in his rookie season. 
Don't you guys don't know later what happened? 
2009-  Alo 2, ham 4
2010-  Alo 2, ham 4
2011- Alo 4, ham 5
2012- Alo 2, ham 4
2013- Alo 2, ham 4. 
Your shit driver out qualified by ham many times both r in top teams. Your ham just a 4th grade driver. He is only enjoying all the wins because of highly advanced merc team.
What ever poles he scored or wins he get no one cares. A driver like nico bottas winning with that car. And he he feels like god of f1 and totto feels like his team is a divine and he is monarch. Fuck you arrogant ham fans. Your driver is just a 4th grade driver. Don't even compare him to greats like senna it's a big insult to them."
296,"Filip Lalovic Really then why you fans overreact for your 4th grade driver. He utters all the shit and you support it. Ok if your ham really have that much stuff then tell him to score a pole with that mclaren. No he can't do it mate. I hate him because of his fans treating him as god and others as shit. And whenever a argument comea they say 2007 he beat alonso. Ahh what about the 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012. Both are in top teams. Get lost man. You people hate other driver more than we do. Blinded  with hamilton fanism."
297,"abhiram muttavarapu Jeez stop with all the hate. Do you actually support anyone in F1, or just live to hate Hamilton because he's British and you're not? 

We can compare him to Senna as he has already won as many WDC'S (possibly more after this year) and has already beaten him in Poles and will most likely hold the all time record for pole positions at the end of the year.

Furthermore, he has won a race every single year  in his career (even when his cars have not been championship material), no one else on the grid right now can make that claim. He has more wins outright than anyone else who is on the grid right now to top it off.

I feel I have countered your hate sufficiently now with rational arguments backed up with facts, but please be respectful to all drivers on the grid. Having a respectful debate will make others consider your argument and maybe even agree with you. Life is too short to be blinded by rage."
298,Are the Ferraris front limited on tracks like Silverstone?
299,"I just reached a P1, sorry for the race, but I still like my orange colored car."

303,"Sebastian Vettel believes Mercedes' pace in qualifying sessions is a 
""gamechanger"" in the 2017 Formula 1 championship fight at the moment.The Ferrari driver saw his lead over Lewis Hamilton cut from 20 points to 
one in the British Grand Prix, which Hamilton won comfortably from pole 
while Vettel slipped back to seventh due to a late tyre failure."

330,"Ferrari needs to step up their development game. Especially engine. It won't matter what they do with aero if mercs have 15-20 more hp every single lap. Also let's not forget them flipping a switch in qualy and getting 30-40 hp up on Ferrari. 
Come on!"
331,"Sometimes I wonder why do I bother to watch such a 'shitty' race where the top 3 is either Mercedes or a Ferrari whereas the remaining teams are ""FUCKED AWAY into the wilderness of mediocrity""."
332,"Kimi and Joelyn really have some rotten luck, but a great day for Lewis and a brilliant drive by Bottas. 

Get well soon Martin Brundle."
333,Kyvat on the way to becoming the new Pastor Maldonado
334,Hamilton is the best damn driver of all time.
335,Hamilton semplicemente perfetto. Aiutate Alonso a fare una gara intera. Ferrari sfortunata
336,What a great track and what a great race! 🏁 we need an home grand prix for vettel again. Bring back the Nürburgring 🇩🇪
337,Ferrari should back Kimi & not Vettel. Vettel doesn't know how to overtake properly!

341,"The ironic comments from the crowd were so funny when Jolyon broke down. Some guy in Luffield shouted *""No, not Jolyon. For the love of God!""* 😂"
342,go BENZ!!
343,i think ferrari's tyre is being SABOTAGE
344,"Hulkenberg is turning into anther Kubica, his performance this season is similar to the one Kubica put in 2010"

349,what a crazy weather!
350,"I can't understand Vettel complaining about moving under braking, when the ban for this has long been lifted. 
And well done to Verstappen for paying him back when Vettel pushed him off the track :)"

354,Does Crofty increase by a decibel between every race?
355,"Suck that up, Vettel! Excelent job, Kimi! The greatest driver that Ferrari have these years.

Lewis and Valtteri... You guys are amazing! Go go, Mercedes!

It is so nice to see two Finns at the podium, and Lewis in first place at Silverstone! Hope this same podium happen again next year!"
356,"There's a lot of talk now about Ferraris line up next year.  Many saying either Vetstappen or Ricciardo.

Do you really think either one will want to be no. 2 to Vettel?  Ferrari always have a no.1, which is Vettel.

I can only see Perez going to Ferrari.  He's a bitch.  He'll fit in well!"
357,"even though ferrari was not in first place, it reminds me of lemans 2016 with toyota, failure in the last lap"

364,Karma strikes Ferrari.
365,"As bad as I may seem I really believe that if Ferrari didn't have the shitty luck they had today, the race could have possibly been a 2, 3 for Ferrari. I think kimmi  and vettel, as bad as things seem, are an amazing team together. And I feel like they should have gotten higher positions today but i guess luck was not on their side..."
366,Mercedes supremacy SADLY
367,Good drive by Ricciardo!
368,I miss the Formula 1 of the beginning of the century and the end of the last one.What is this here?DRS? What a joke.The cars sound so horrible. And they also look so ugly.I stopped being a fan of Formula One.

381,Mmm
382,I wonder if Vettel would have survived if he had not suffered that huge lock-up when Bottas was chasing him.
383,I loved and hated this race because Kimi's puncture
384,go go hamilton!!!!
385,Alonso don't deserves such a shitty team like McLaren-Honda.
386,"Ferrari won't win this year, so do you want to win next year?==> FERNANDO ALONSO first pilot of Ferrari... Fuck off Mercedes!"
387,Balnazzardi jajajajajaja too laught you
388,"Well too bad for you, but Marchionne clearly stated that there is no room in Ferrari for Alonso :D....Ferrari will most likely continue with their current line-up for 1 more year, then try to get either Ricciardo or Verstappen as Vettel's team-mate for 2019."
389,Kvyat master :D
390,V6😤
391,1:46 See you later
392,Why does Ferrari have to shit on Räikkönen? He's a lot more cool-headed than Vettel.
393,This is the first race that I wasn't able to watch live in years.  So this highlights video is great & I love it!  Thanks.
394,shut leclerc be in kvyat's seat
395,...what about Verstappens late pit stop for tires ??
396,vettel😣
397,"I love the fact that the official channel of formula 1 must speed up the video to avoid the strike by the bots i guess 
Thanks Youtube"
398,"The winner is always predictable. When Hamilton gets pole, you don't need to watch the race because Hamilton always gets faster and faster every lap. The gap between all teams is too big. Mercedes is just too fast. The overtakes were too easy with the help of DRS.👎👎👎"

410,Honda sucks
411,TORPEDDDOOOOOOO!
412,"Vettel was stupid, he should have entered the pits the moment his tyre burst instead of going round another lap like he did dragging his front."
413,those cornering speeds this year though
414,"I'm not exactly sure why Vettel had his hand up when Verstappen shoved him wide, but it's okay for Vettel to do it to him. I think it's a racing incident."
415,i just stopped watching the race at L47 then this bad luck happen at least kimi finish in the Podium
416,idk if I've ever seen a DNS before 😂
417,Vettel's puncture came on the same tyre that he locked up massively on lap 43
418,"Shenanigans afoot at Silverstone:

Alonso launches an engine (par for the course at this point).
Verstappen proves he still drives while suffering from cranial-rectal insertion.
Kimi on podium (BWOAHH!!!).
Ham-ster closes the Championship gap before heading into part 2 of the season.
Ferrari clearly got ahold of tires meant for McLaren."
419,this race for not too many crashes was exciting and entertaining due to the amount of sick overtakes!
420,"I dont think ferrari can match 
Mercedes anymore i think vettels championship campaign might be over"
421,fuck Hamilton
422,Sensational drive from Ricciardo!!!!
423,Very good race .

433,Max is rubbish too.
434,Where are the Vettel fanboys? Too busy crying huh.
435,Where is Stroll?
436,Dude someone is fucking with ferrari or their luck is really FUCKING dry right now.
437,"Kimi in podium be like : ""Bwooaah, I don't have idea what I'm doing here."""
438,"some of you say this race may boring, but when i watch Ricciardo livestream it is full of overtakes. GO RICCIARDO! GO RBR! GO MAX!"
439,"Shafwan Dito Thats because all the cars he passed are 1 to 3 seconds slower per lap ;D. Untill he comes to max, Ferrari and Mercedes, he can just drive and chill. He wont overtake max ever when max is in front. Not with the same car. Even the way faster Ferrari of vettel couldnt do it."
440,"Do you think Hamilton is the best British F1 driver ever?
I never think so.
Nowadays F1 destroy great F1 history. "

445,Karma
446,Great race!
447,I find the red bull drivers more impressive than the Ferrari's and the Mercs. what's making the difference is the performance of their cars.
448,Bad luck for Kimi continues........through all his career.....(-__-!!)
449,"Alonso dead, not big surprise"
450,3:08 You can hear Fernando's spotter's soul being crushed right in this moment.
451,This Crofty has an obnoxious voice when he yells. Though I understand it's for excitement but it is.
452,The torpedo's back at it again
453,When Ferrari is just so good in the first part of the season but sucks up in the end
454,"Alonso: No power!

Team: maybe we should move to Formula E, as we're just ""embarrassing"" ourselves in F1"

465,Super enjoyable grand prix.  The battle between Vettel and Max was great to watch.
466,Sebastian Vettel win win
467,wao wao beautiful great race:congratulations Halmiton peace
468,Bottas.  biggest douche ever
469,"apparently, Lewis was interviewed by someone who's much, MUCH faster than him

Owen Wilson ☺"
470,"6:20 who is that girl on the podium stage with her cell phone in portrait mode no less?  Lucky fan?  trophy presenter?  


Seems odd."
471,Can we all just appreciate that Verstappen finished the race?
472,Ricciardo was a fucking beast this race
473,bad day for ferraris
474,"Why was Verstappen held so long in the pitstop? too bad he didn't make 3rd, he looked to be in good shape today."
475,"Strong performance by Ricciardo, Hamilton, Bottas and Hulkenberg. Sad day for Alondo (again) and Palmer. Red Bull still has a huge gap to the top 4"
476,"Well done, Dany! As instructed!"
477,shit!!!!!!!
478,Why does Formula One remind me of pro wrestling and NASCAR? There's something fake about this shit.
479,Defender of the day: Max Verstappen
480,"You know what really bothers me? That no one tries to defend their position, at all costs. Only Verstappen does, but even when he does it he still gets stick. That's how rare it has become nowadays; people think he's doing something wrong. 
I think Senna would've got hammered by the comments if he raced in this era. He was harder to get past than the Berlin Wall, no one was able to overtake him. Nowadays they almost move over to the side when a faster car approaches. It's so silly."
481,Minimal talking. Maximal hitting.
482,"Those Mercedes cars are so good and fast  , does not matter who you put in them they win every time , well done Mercedes ."
483,I'm always impressed by how constant Ocon is in every GP... If only he get a better car !

491,Vettel fucking sucks!
492,I fucking hate Lewis Hamilton. He's a flog.
493,Vettel fans seem to be hiding from this comment section this time
494,"Wellington? Wasn't that Hanger? 
That really dates me."
495,"Wellington Straight? Where did that come from?
Guaranteed to disenchant the French. I like it already."
496,Hamilton is only good if he drives a good car. I would love to see him driving a Mclaren-Honda
497,Left front tire broke :/
498,I hate those easy wins !
499,thanks Lewis GodBless you too .. You are the living legend of formula 1 .. what a time to be alive and see you shining
500,Can we take a moment to appreciate Riccardo doing an F1 season's worth of overtakes in one race?
501,Give Ricciardo an extra 30hp and it won't matter where he qualifies he'll be top 3 every race (one eyed Aussie here!)
502,THAT'S HOW YOU DO IT!!
503,"Max doesn't even play around👏👏
and how about that Bottas,2nd position from 6th or wherever the penalty placed him 💪💪"
504,In other news. Hamilton investigated by the FIA for dropping nails on the circuit.
505,British F1 fans are such bandwagons
506,Hamilton made this look easy 
507,Can we please acknowledge Nico Hülkenberg finishing in P6?
508,i hate Croft's voice
509,didn't kyvat get a penalty for rejoining the track dangerously good job vettel moved out to ovoid max
510,get rid of Kvyat
511,All my thoughts are with Jolyon's hydraulics
512,I only come here for the fake accounts
513,Hamilton does it again to try and take back the Lead in points again for another Championship
514,Crofty must be the worse commentator.
515,"And Mercedes has again the fastest car... i love f1 and i really appreciate the work mercedes is doing, but what is wrong with ferrari... they started so solid and now it seems like no updates are coming anymore (c'mon 15 hp update wasn't even worth).... the have to overwork the complete aerodynamics of their car until Belgium"
516,Anyone else just want Alonso to win a race?
517,Come on Renault. Give Palmer a good car. I bet he could of been fighting with the Force India's today.
518,"it seems like i have jinxed 2 races already. in baku i told my friends ""I don't think red bull will win a race this season."" and later i told them "" imagine, lewis having a puncture in his home grand prix."""
519,"Funny how so many are complaining about Vettel's complaints, completely ignoring that 80% of the driver field is doing that. Liberty Media is just showing mainly the team radio of Ferrari and Mercedes. And since the two Finns are well known for their sparing of words, it's just Hamilton and Vettel with complaints all the time. Get over it, ever watched football?"
520,get well soon martin brundle
521,"Recent footage shows how nintendo is sponsering bananas, red shells and bob-ombs to kvyat. He also gets a star upgrade for not damaging his car if he hits others."
522,ferrari still the best...
523,5:52 how the mecanic gets his hands on his head
524,We want the return of Paul di resta in F1 :(
525,I'm honestly sad for Alonso. Poor man.
526,I fucking hate Hamilton
527,Honestly ?
528,Not a really enjoyable race with some exceptions like Ricciardo and Bottas!
529,What about Palmer?
530,"I believe if another team picks up Alonso, it may be a major advantage to them. I say that solely because I'm sure he has some rage built and he's wanting to compete. Any team would give him a better chance than Honda surely."
531,What a race today.
532,nobody can stop bottas that's it. He is gonna win
533,well done Lewis 👏
534,Get well soon Martin Brundle.
535,I wish it was possible to watch entire race through youtube :(
536,Vettel's front left defining jump start. It went off before it should have xD
537,"""Minimal talking"""
538,"puncture! puncture! puncture! that was the best part of the race, where's the vettel fans?"
539,"Wow, bad luck Ferrari."
540,This shit is rigged
541,ya think
542,Hah. Karma seb
543,"From a massive Vettel fan, congratulations to Lewis Hamilton for the race victory. He was clearly the best today (and yesterday) and deserved the win."
544,"Fucking hell, Scuderia!!!!!!!"
545,I like how vetel cries when somebody else pushes him out of the track...  like he does always when they are going to pass him
546,ferrari fucked up their tyre strat :/
547,What a fuck up by Ferrari.
548,Palmer ones more without points! Robert Kubica must back!
549,Lewis Halmiton ✌👌😎
550,In my opinion Bottas drive wasn't anything special. The first five cars should be quite easy for a Mercedes to overtake and he didn't have to push too much to close the gap to vettel as he was stuck behind verstappen. Then he was lucky that raikkonen had a tyre problem. And it isn't that hard to overtake a car when you have a drs and a boost button that makes you go at least 20km/h faster on the straights. I don't like the boost things. Not in qualifying and not in race. It should only be acceptable if they can drive with that boost on during the whole race. Not a Hamilton hater just want to see good racing. With that said it still was a decent race. Not as good as Baku but better then some other races this season.
551,Riccardo had a amazing race
552,has Alonso even finished one race?
553,my left front tire is.........broke. lol
554,"Hello, iam new to this sport. Can someone guide me.
My brain is damaged."
555,"2016 vettel: Bad

556,"Kvyat crashes into Sainz putting him out of race.

Palmer's car broke during formation lap.

Nando didn't finish the race.

Nothing new really ..."
557,"Can someone ban kyviat from driving again.. insane.. and switch alonsos car with his team mate, wth why is he always retiring?!"
558,Kvyat is getting quite a reputation
559,"I have no idea why it is in my recommendations, but I've watched it all and, I think, from now on I'm an F1 fan"
560,welcome
561,all those drivers are pussies!
562,Why Perrez and Ocon were so slow compared to Riccardo when he passed both off them?
563,"One of my friends is a Vettel fan. He called Verstappen a son of a bitch for defending like that. He won't listen to me, but he might listen to the comments on that. Can you tell him to stop watching F1?"
564,"Seb / Kimi - Tyre fails/punctures/whateverhappened

Same tyre. Same part of the track. :("
565,"the torpedo strikes g
again"
566,That tyre lock during Bottas overtake cost Vettel his tires

585,its boring again
586,"Ferrari's tires were been sabotage!




 just for the sake of argument... 😁"
587,Kimi was obviously the most excited on the podium
588,"""F**k...my left front tyre... broke"""
589,I love f1 i just really dont want halo cockpits!! I mean come on!
590,Next time Kimi :( I felt bad for him.
591,No power No power
592,feel so bad for vettel. hopefully he'll come back in Hungary
593,he will :)
594,Fuck off Pirelli
595,"Yandere Player FIA asks to Pirelli tyres' requirements, if it was Bridgestone or Michelin or Hankook or every other brand in the world it would be exactly the same. (And to everyone readings, yes, it's a copy and paste)."
596,poor kimi... he drove really well
597,"Pre-race Palmer can finally score points awesome.

607,@Daniil Kvyat hi daniil did u watch this 2017 highlights while waiting for this Sunday's race in 2020???
608,"Hey Maldonado, what do you think about the Kvyat's replacement Max Crashtappen? He is doing a great performance isn't he?"
609,Pastor Maldonado Yeah too bad that He got kicked out even before the end of the season.What the hell is wrong with Lotus and Toro Rosso?Why did they kicked out the new f1 legends?! (Forget Fangio Mansell Prost Senna Schumacher Alonso Hamilton)
610,Ferrari is old!
611,"hakuna mutata They did, and even Mercedes upgrades the car, but this is a power track where Mercedes and their drivers have some datas more then the others since they present and test their car here, the Mercedes is a car studied and suited for this particular track, and they even had the luck for Ferrari's bad luck. If they raced in Fiorano or Ferrari tested in Monza they would smoke the opponents because they would have that knowledge in more too about the car's behaviour with the track and a car ""perfect"" for the track (just like Enzo Ferrari wanted ""every car has to be perfect for this track, or it won't be produced or it won't race""), ""unfortunately"" they have since 1972 Fiorano's test track that can't host an F1 race."
612,they need to upgrade their engine.
613,"Jay Paul Hernandez Yes, it's the only team entering every race since Silverstone 1950 and racing since 1929, even Enzo Ferrari is old with his 119 years."
614,great race
615,"Decent race I suppose, bit boring at times though it got spiced up at the end. Hate to see what is happening to Alonso, one of the great drivers of the sport get DNF week after week due to being with such a shoddy team, I mean, it's sad also to see McLaren become such a second rate team."
616,exelente carrera  lamento lo de Ferrari

623,"The Sidz Mercedes, a team testing and presenting his car in Silverstone and Bottas (not taking away anything from him) having a faster and fresher compound with less fuel, so less weight and so less degradation, and both the Mercedes' drivers helped by their rivals' punctures at the end of the race."
624,The podium music starts and the finns start to drink. Brilliant :D
625,"When someone do ""YES!"" or ""Never give up"" t-shirts?"

627,Congrats Lewis...superb victory..especially after bad luck in Baku and then having to take a grid penalty..Good luck ahead!!
628,"6:06 Thank you Liberty Media, for listening to us fans"
629,Hamilton be lucky he is in the fastest car this is one thing and second thing is Vettel must have a pitstop
630,"""minimal talking""??!!!"
631,If a driver goes from P19 to P6 that easy that there is something really wrong with this whole F1 shizzle.

633,Lewis scampered off into the distance never to even be threatened by anyone and you call this a RACE?? Jeez. Yawwwwn.
634,"Give him the SAME car as EVERY other current driver and I'd bet my limbs and eyesight that Alonso would trounce Hamilton. Hamilton's no legend, (DESPITE the 'impressive' numbers), I assure you."

642,"2:16 * Vettel pushes Verstappen all the way off the track *
- 5 second later 
* Verstappen pushes Vettel off the track (Payback) *
* Vettel gets mad and puts his hand in the air *

Vettel is a 10 year old whiny bitch"
643,Petilsan Oh and remember Hamilton in 2012 Venezuela?
644,"Petilsan Seriously, fuck off, I hate it when people keep saying this when Alonso, Senna, and even Raikkonen complains a lot more but never gets hate, that's fucking bull shit, and every driver complains, jesus fuck."
645,"FerryXtheMercy max was never gonna let him past easily, i knew eventually vettel would end up on the grass😂"
646,"Alves Gomes Me too, though a bit surprised no-one mentions the most appropriate word for that kind of behaviour: (what a) hypocrite !
Loved Max' reaction over team radio though: ""he wants to play bumper cars"" 😂"
647,Petilsan so glad im not the only one who notices vettels bitchy behaviour. its fine when hes doing it but when the tables are turned he cant take the heat.
648,Crofty called 2 different drivers Paul di resta
649,tire sabotage confumed
650,The early undercuts costs Ferrari in the final laps.
651,Pirelli sabotaged us.  Soft tyres should last better!!!
652,"Zikri Hakim 
Yes indeed it did so."
653,"My reaction to Kimi's tyre was pity and disappointment, my reaction to Vettel's tyre was smug laughter"
654,I know this is old but I still laugh every time I watch it
655,Tom Salmon same
656,British fans better out there according to Hamilton. Better than the Italian fans? Yeah... I guess he is simply wrong.
657,"I would say British fans are equal to Italian fans, there is no way to prove which is better other than your own bias, so get your head out of your ass and just accept that they are both passionate about the sport."
658,"Good to see the torpedo doing what he does best... jokes aside, how the f**k does he still have a seat in f1 ?"
659,"Nigel Mansell Yea I don't think he'd of made it to F1 in the first place without being quick, but I think his recklessness outweighs his quickness by far !"
660,Thanks Pirelli!
661,"TeddyLXIX Thanks FIA, they asks to Pirelli tyres' requirement."
662,NO! WE COULDN'T SEE SHIT BECAUSE OF THAT CAMERA ANGLE !!!!
663,can any one tell me why Alonso didn't start at pole.. he did finish p1
664,My best race this season
665,What kind of name is jolyion. damn
666,Best!
667,Yeah Lewis what win #LH44 hammer time
668,wish hamilton crashed in a massive fire ball..
669,"not really... until blacks aint a cost on our societies, you will get it..."
670,What a loser you are. Don't you think it's bad that i know the colour of your skin without seeing it? so predictable and so despicable.
671,is no one going to talk about how impressive of a drive Ricciardo and Hulkenberg had?
672,"The battle who is winning the Championschip is ofc really interesting - i think since the last  3-4 years. But ist just a battle of 3 people. They have obviously the fastest cars. Imo it would be a great sport with the sams cars, well same motor units and some strict rules would be fine."
673,get a better commentator than fat twat croft.
674,Yuck!!!
675,dang this is so boring. no wonder no one watches f1 anymore
676,cya then!
677,"Bam, Verstappen finishes, fourth position already :D That's just great, gj Max"
678,This race cut me deep
679,The Torpedo strikes again
680,Can we just age restrict YouTube? I'm sure these fake accounts can't be controlled by anyone over 14.
681,"Team: Good job! Bottas :""Minimum Talking! "" Guess the Fin's will always be Fin's"
682,Karim Akele Bwoahttas
683,i just love f1
684,thank god vettel got a puncture today. would've been so annoyed if vettel got away with getting a podium out of nothing!
685,"Just realizing:
When Vettel pushes Verstappen wide, Crofty says: ""Verstappen goes off the track"", while Vettel clearly pushes him wide.
When Verstappen does the same at the chicane, he says: ""Vettel gets pushed off the track."" 

Biased commentary much?"
686,"Impossible....  They are  BRITISH,  they often don't even like Vettel and Ferrari but support Hamilton and Mercedes,,  why would they favor  Sebastian over Max?"
687,"SSsvaedsg eymxgs Yes, but still Crofty tends to dowplay Max his actions quite often. Also, he's quite arrogant for someone who has very little racing experience, he needs to tone it down a bit and listen to the real pundits lik Brundle."
688,"croft is a joke, bad one, but i think they cut away in the middle of the corner, so at the time it wasn't so clear"
689,Why should he?
690,"I think it's down to the angles they had at the time, when they saw if from above they said that Vettel pushed Max off."
691,God bless you Hamilton
692,0:07 ask Alonso he would tell you how it feels
693,Yes it is very upsetting.
694,"Stroll: I'm the new Maldonado
Kvyat: Bitch please?"
695,Max Verstappen = aggressiveness + intelligence + skill
696,"Car Guy tell me when he cried for blue flags and he doesn't blame others really often and when he does he's usually right.

So just keep it down a bit hater"
697,And arrogance and blamikng others and crying for blue flags
698,"Dietrich, it's all a part of a recent Liberty deal, remember? Dany is liberating F1 with his driving. Of course, we're set for some lucrative percentage as a result, so I know what I'm doing."
699,No doubt about that
700,I got skillz too!
701,I started watching F1 this year..I've been missing a lot the past years
702,Wehrlein and Ericsson are such bad drivers.......
703,Kyvat again really?
704,Hamilton is just too good....
705,"Gatoula GR alright calm down kid, no need to throw your toys out the pram. And it was the previous race at Austria he changed his gearbox, which he got a 5 place penalty for. It was Bottas who changed his gearbox at Silverstone and also got a penalty. Now let's talk about the lack of black flag for Vettel driving alongside Hamilton and ramming into him..."
706,j4w7 MERCEDES IS PAYING FIA GOOD THATS WHY HAMILTON WINS SOMETIMES LIKE THIS RACE HE CHANGED GEARBOX WHERE IS PENALTY??? HE MAKE SOMEOME LATE HIS BEST LAP WHERE IS PENALTY??? MERCEDES IS PAYING FIA
707,No.1 Hardstylebaby that may be true but you can't deny the skills you see consistently
708,j4w7 correction Bottas and Hamilton are good with good cars
709,"around Silverstone he is, but there is still so many races to go, i expect it to still be close."
710,"What the hell is Kvyat doing in the Toro Rosso, I hope he gets out of F1 soon, and maybe replaced by Gasly."
711,great drive from Ricciardo
712,i didnt like the race. In lap 50 i started to hate it.
713,Ferrari fan?
714,Worst fucking race... Really worth the dislike.
715,As I said this kind of shit happens to Ferrari only. What a coincidence... easy to be a fashion Mercedes fan you know. A blind camel without legs could win with that car..
716,"Let me guess, Ferrari fan? Their fans stick out because they always start crying and throwing a hissy fit when things don't go their way."
717,No I can't live without it... Really unfortunate that these kind of shits only happens with Ferrari... Bullshit at its finest.
718,Watch another sport then
719,Without that lock up vs Bottas Vettel would finish 3rd!
720,Both Bottas and Raikkonen always drink before they start spraying it😂❤️❤️
721,make custom thumbnails!!
722,once a 4 time champion NOW A FIVE TIME CHAMPION ITS
723,"Poor Alonso ... there where better teams haha, he's still talented af"
724,Driver of the day: Daniil Kvyat
725,Kvyatorpedo
726,"I wonder, if that huge lock up from Seb caused the Punchture..?"
727,xLeThal -SmokE It helped.
728,Mercedes have found their dominance again... they've overtaken Ferrari finally.... what a shit race it was for Ferrari 😔
729,"carbonfighterfan96 Mercedes presents its cars in Silverstone, so they test them on this track, it's a car studied for this circuit, it's like if they raced in Fiorano instead of Monza or Ferrari would have tested its cars in Monza."
730,Why did Verstappen pitted in lap 50? He could've gone 2 more easier laps and get 3rd place.
731,#palmerout
732,"He really needs to find a new way of starting a race other than ""it's lights out and away we go."""
733,Youtube must be rolling in cash when all of these people make new accounts for every single race to make jokes about the events. :D
734,See vettel... karma is a bitch..
735,If this race had rain 🤔
736,"Awww, Hamilton didn't role his car, what a waste of a shooting star!!! Anyway there's always next race"
737,He's not shit that's why.
738,I love races like this where the drama which ISN'T contrived by the buffoons in race control.
739,Hello guys Im another stupid fake account and Im doing this because its so funny and I can earn some likes. *INSERT STUPID F1 MEME* BWOAH HONESTLY ONE MORE LAP
740,Mate you're killing it :D
741,God damn Daniel what the fuck are you doing...?
742,I loved this race! Screw you vettel!
743,"Honestly what are we doing, bumper cars or racing?"
744,Except Vettel and Verstappen fight and the blown up tyres of the ferraris the race was boring as fuck.
745,4:12 Ouch! :(
746,@Simpai he is now
747,It's funny cause he's flat
748,This was funny because you're not a fake driver.
749,"Man, is there a way for Fernando to sue Mclaren-Honda for wasting 1 year of his life?"
750,Yeah go back to 2007 and 2008 and not cheat so the FIA will now accept his bribes.
751,Didn't jump a start this time
752,"Valtteri Bottas 
you didn't jump it last week"
753,Good for you
754,Anyone else hate both vettel and hamilton?
755,yea
756,How did Ricciardo overtake Hülkenberg? They did not show that even in the race.
757,"I wish we could just agree to stop upvoting the fake driver comments, the joke is getting really old really quickly"
758,It's lights out and away we go

764,Lewis Hamilton being 1st in all the laps without loosing places
765,Can we just have the rest of the season in baku?
766,Il mondiale è  ancora lungo Mercedes non avrà vita facile. FORZA FERRARI
767,some are already smoking while starting..
768,I really hate Mercedes f1 team. Really boring. Not good for the sport.
769,"it's not they're fault if they are so good ... the other teams are just less competitives , and dont't forget that Ferrari is going well -.-"
770,Ferrari's tires weren't strong enough to resist the shockwave of that Torpedo..
771,"Let Mercedes, Ferrari and Red Bull start from the back, much more interesting :)"
772,"Race made me feel kind of nostalgic... Hamilton in a silver car and Kimi in the red car at the front of the pack, just like the old days!"
773,That ending was crazy
774,Great performance Daniel 👍
775,"Great drive from Hamilton he had by far best car today but deserved standing ovation. Shame Ferrari lost both cars with 2 laps to go especially Kimi :( Also brilliant fight Verstappen vs Vettel and superb drive from Nico Hulkenberg and Daniel Ricciardo. That was some race, great job Silverstone"
776,How much horsepower is the engine making and the MGU-K and the MGU-H are making? Why are the cars still slower than the 2004-2005 season cars? Its been 13 years since then....
777,"MrJuggernautishere Apart for different layouts, you have to check the qualifying laps, in Q sessions teams are allowed to use all the performance of their cars, for race session you have to consider that F1 sporting regulation changed, for example the refueling, cars were lighter during all the race and never had to preserve the fuel (even if in some cases most if the cars run out of fuel) and tires, so less degradation and more tries for the quickest lap if the race, while now they have to race with 100 Kg of fuel and have some remaining for FIA's fuel test at the end."
778,"an other boring race. Thank god i didnt cut my sleep short to watch this. F1, extremely boring since 2014"
779,Russian torpedo best torpedo.  100% reliability.  Never misses target.
780,Mercedes slashed ferraris tyres before race
781,Boring GP and now the championship is over... Not worth to watch the remaining races
782,"Alberto19951995 it is intense, but When Baku and Le mans Motogp in the same day i was going crazy and i make it as best weeknd ever. because both races were exciting asfuuuuuck"
783,I restarted watching Moto gp since 2015 and I find it more tense than f1.
784,"Alberto19951995 watch MotoGP then mate, every race in MotoGP always unpredictable"
785,"asimb0mb yup, but if you compare with motogp championship they had 5 Riders fighting for no.1! and they all closing each other"
786,We have three drivers fighting for the championship. Not sure how that's boring.
787,"'Honestly, what is Kvyat doing in f1!'"
788,kan je beter doen? gaar maar lekker biertje drinken. honestly!
789,fuck UK
790,Daniil Kvyat does not belong in Formula 1!!
791,"Kimi:fuck me.
me:Gladly, what time."
792,was Brundle sick today?
793,Hamilton has glitched tyre wear
794,2020 british gp disagrees
795,Good luck to both Kvyat and Palmer finding a seat for next year... Not a snowballs chance in hell.
796,"you do bring up good points, havent heard that rumor yet, we'll see what happens. Usually trade rumors start after the summer break, around singapore, lets see what happens this year"
797,"Also, he seems to be a little scared of F1 cars, you saw what happened when Kvyat tried to come back on track in Baku (I believe Baku, could also be another race)"
798,"Petar P Carlos senior was spreading rumors that Verstappen ""signed with Ferrari"", just so Red Bull and Verstappen got into a argument and he could take the seat.

Rumors are now that he will be fired."
799,"nah, Carlos has had bad luck, Danny has screwed him over many times this season..."
800,Petar P and Carlos.
801,"Why Hamilton won again i wanted  Sebastian to win, that's so unfair!!!!! (Like whoever agrees!)"
802,im a mclaren honda fan our engines suck we dont get pole now do you see us wienie no we make memes about mclaren
803,"+Chris Parker   Because Vettel gave it all whilst Hamilton was just cruising,   yet  Hamilton had luck of having the fastest  car,   and those damn Pirelli tyres sucked so bad taht they blew on both Ferraris!!!"
804,It's Hamilton's home so he have rights to delight his home fans!
805,Chris Parker Because i am fan of Sebastian Vettel and Ferrari!!!!
806,TheodoraPaoG13 how is it unfair lol?
807,"Hamilton is a great driver, but his has such a fake personality. Always kissing ass and being politically correct. Boring as shit."
808,"wouldnt be a 2017 grand prix, if both mclarens finished"
809,Minimal talking.
810,Shrike typical Finn. Thats what channel 4 commentator retorted
811,Guys don't listen to Carlos its me that will go to Red Bull next year!!
812,"Daniil Kvyat 
you absolutely suck"
813,Dr. Helmut Marko it's what everyone expect :v
814,I see you have great analytical skills over there
815,Dr. Helmut Marko hey marko put kvyat on rb and let sainz in str :V
816,For sure
817,CAN YOU BELIEVE IT PAUL DI RESTA???
818,the torpedo is back twice
819,Vettel leads only by 1 point now. I can't wait for the next race!
820,Lol
821,"+Gold 999  True,   Mercedes got them and even the Italian tyre manufactorer in their pocket.  What a load of bastards.  If the Scuderia wins this they've really deserved it more than anyone and it will show great strength,  against all odds."
822,He leads by 8 points
823,Are you predicting the future?
824,"vettel's will win, but the steward will help hamilton and kill vettel...formula 1 ass"
825,Fuck the police!
826,wheres the Onboard footage from the main man the Torpedo himself Daniil Kvyat?
827,"hamilton affected grojeans lap in qualifying----> no further action needed.
verstappen passed vettel by going outside off the track----> no further action needed.the rest are just history.well done fia.nice job."
828,When people say Ferrari had a disaster at the end but they only lost 9 points...
829,"Luke Montgomery Well there are people saying the championship is over, but vettel only has a one point lead. And a great race from bottas coinciding with a bad performance of the two leader will see him catch up"
830,"Well Vettel all but lost his lead in WDC and Mercedes is alreayd more than 50 points ahead of them,.....so ye I would call that quite bad weekend, especially since it seems that once again Ferrari has failed to keep up with development race."
831,Watch how all the top comments are from fake driver accounts. WHAT A TIME TO BE ALIVE 😂😆
832,My tires bwoahk
833,"I know Lewis will go down in history as one of the greats. But fuck that guy. I never hated on vettel when he was dominating RB and won 4 titles, just because he was dominating.

But I'll hate on Lewis. Always thought he was an annoying asshat that was never a concern because he was at a uncontentious McLaren or 2013 kinda up there Mercedes. 

Now that he's got the car and at the forefront I hate his fucking guts.

Alonso should be up there. But he makes the most unlucky/stupid moves. He'll give me vettel again. Now I'm rooting for him to escape the argument that the RB car was the sole reason why he had so many titles."
834,"Vettel will never escape the fact that he couldn't do jack shit in a car without a blown diffuser. When his RB didn't have it he was getting his ass beat by Webber and then when it was banned in 2014 he got destroyed by Ricciardo. Its a noticeable difference, he simply does not drive the same way now that he does not have a car on rails."
835,"🎵TorpedoMan, TorpedoMan, he plays bowling with his car🎵"
836,Honda needs to put a VTEC in the McLaren. 😂
837,Koji Takata I'm pretty sure turning the engine into a potato would do better than the current mcclaren set up XD
838,"Hamilton dances onto the podium 
Raikkönen was like ""Bwoah, what is he doing"""
839,GP Brazzil O Melhor Ayton Senna
840,Kvyat's torpedo has gone too far
841,Brazzilll
842,"- Always love watching the drivers dart around at the start

- *Kvyat slowly ruining his F1 future/career*

- Ricciardo on a charge again and making short work of what was in front of him

- Force India may have cost themselves a better finishing position again because they don't have the guts for team orders

- More misery for Alonso unfortunately

- Nice overtakes throughout the race

- Bottas drove fantastic again

- *Kimi deserved P2*

- Karma for Vettel

- Max finished, finally

Good race"
843,Jraybay Well surmised
844,voml Yes this is much better than the old overused jokes and fake driver profiles etc. We need more of these. The normal comments
845,Bjay _23 because of Baku
846,"Jraybay why ""Karma"" for Vettel?"
847,"Track limits! Verstappen off the track and overtaking. What funny rules F1 established!
Man, the F1 game is so unrealistic right now. Everytime you're off with all 4 wheels you get a penalty."
848,"And McLaren-Honda crying about Alonso losing faith on them... 3 years, I don't know about faith, but he really has a lot of patience"
849,Don Quijote he gets more mony in one year than you will ever have in your entire live so i guess he gets over it
850,"The fact both Ferraris had a tire blowout mere moments before the end of the race just shows you how much these drivers are pushing their cars and their tires to the absolute limits.
And the fact that after only 10 laps there must have been a good Kilo of rubber debris in Cops corner just shows what corner exactly stressed the tires so much. 260 in that right hander at extremely hard steering, no wonder those tires gave way."
851,"You should have seen how loud I laughed when both Ferraris tires blew up






Coming from Hamilton fan

Get in Lewis"
852,You're grasping and reaching. Its sad really. Rosberg was aided by reliability problems for Hamilton. Go ahead a deny the facts. Rosberg was a very good driver.
853,121bham last year maylasia was so funny cant wait for it to happen this year
854,Nick 2005 i find it so funny how these dipshit hamilton fans think hes such a great driver and british but he lost to rosberg in a 2 way title fight and doesnt even give a shit about them lol
855,121bham I don't know why I keep imagining you as that indian kid who just discover the internet wearing those dorky glasses who are surprisingly okay at playing FIFA
856,"20832_Green Hell No one in our stand necessarily laughed but more a big ""WAYYYYY"" ya know"
857,6:12 Lewis celebrates and Finns drink😂
858,"ich haße Hamilton
i hate hamilton"
859,Kimi's career summarized in one race
860,What a black day for Ferrari fans..
861,coming from an mclaren honda fan
862,what a black 3 years for mclaren fans
863,What about now. Can you Ferrari fans still see the light
864,Ahm97 After the Asian races this is a joke
865,Yes
866,"F2 was much more exciting than this.
Sad days....."
867,"Real winners today were Red Bull. Huge race for Ricciardo, finish for Verstappen."
868,how is your shift going?
869,Raymond Kobes agree
870,Finally a useful comment xDD
871,Raymond Kobes agree
872,I hate Hamilton
873,heh fxxk
874,J Samuels Why you crying?
875,"J Samuels Vettel was crying when Verstappen did the same thing to him, squeezing him off the road. Face it Vettel moans about something every race"
876,J Samuels Every driver is like that.
877,"Frederick Dorsey why ! because he's a crying baby , sneaky , snakey , only happy when he wins , spits his dummy out when shit gets heated  ,fake little FXXXXR i really can not stand this guy grrrrrrrrrrrrr he's like a fly around your food just wanna slap the fxxxxr out . crying crying crying crying boo hoo hoo hoo I didnt win I want my daddyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy whaaaaaaaa 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭  Vettel ram the fxxk off the road son 👍👍"
878,Max is like a dog with a bone. ROFL!
879,Not a fan of Palmer but felt sorry for him today.
880,can you get to jump on to milk and Lava
881,"I dont think renault should decide on their lineup until later this year, not until Palmer actually finishes some races so they can see his pace. Ik hes been slower than hulkenberg in quali and races hes finished, but honestly thats not been many races cuz hes had more reliability issues than verstappen this year, and thats saying something. Once he finishes some races without reliability issues then renault should evaluate their drivers for next year."
882,"He's had quite a few reliability issues this year. He has been slow, but man he's getting so unlucky"
883,I don't :)
884,Morw like for every races haha
885,Again a retirement caused by me...
886,"No, you not. You finished 15th on that race"
887,@Scott R here waiting for 2020 Sochi gan.
888,Torpedo strikes again
889,Its ok
890,I watched the video of the accident on f1 com and on the 36-37 second you can see that Kvyat was catching the car from skidding. He turned the steering wheel to the right completely for a split second and then Sainz jumped out of there ... There is nothing you could do. The judges' decision on the penalty points is stupidity. This is a racing incident. And that's all. Bad luck continues
891,Man those Mercedes are overpowered...
892,Will everyone stop hating on Hamilton. The Hamilton-Vettel battle will be looked back upon as one of the greats. We need to appreciate it now before its too late!
893,"well, the battle is over, Hamilton ha got this one... Mercedes is faster than Ferrari now, its not like the start of the season anymore... Mercedes has outpaced Ferrari in both quali and race so by the end of Hungary Lewis will be leading the championship and Bottas is going to be his closest rival from now on"
894,mrmarvel8 yes plus 3 world championships
895,Yup. Another racist moron making f1 fans look idiotic. Or maybe it is just the majority of the ones with yt accounts and who have nothing better to do than write out their frustration to the internet
896,"Hamilton is a whiny little emo bitch.

He's like a woman on her rags when something doesn't go his way."
897,What are you on about? Vettel leads by one point so how does Merc have the better car??
898,"The Toro Rosso drivers drove completely playstationed. The Mercedes drivers and Hulk did a great job today, however I felt also sorry for Ferrari."
899,I feel sorry for Kimi not for Vettel
900,"F1 from Codemasters is sim-cade, not a simulator"
901,Turn the racing line off then we will talk
902,yeah but unlike you I don't use any assists
903,Daniil Kvyat Which I'm also better at
904,Vettel maybe I can teach you something about tyres strategy
905,MrCrafty 😂
906,grow up kids 🤣🤣🤣
907,"Arkos39 If that was not fair, nothing is"
908,Nah he'd rather ask Ricci
909,CITIZEN CALCULATOR you think you're slick
910,"To the F1 channel, block the people impersonating the drivers"
911,"Eddie Russell yeh keep using 'gay' when you're talking about something bad, homophobic kiddo"
912,UKFreedomFighters it's really not comical. It's just gay as shit
913,Why? Its quite comical to see and anyone with half a functioning brain cell can see that they are fake.
914,indeed its fun :D loving that :D sometimes they come up with a good joke :D
915,Stop crying about it and ignore them
916,Heeey. The torpedo strikes again for the second weekend in a row.
917,Alvian Christian  or vettel
918,maybe you can do it for hamilton later 😄
919,"Keep that up in Hungary, maybe with Hamilton 😉"
920,"Wehrlein has more points than you, torpedo! Change the target!"
921,Daniil Kvyat Keep doing that and Haas will over take you guys
922,"McLaren:Wow new spec engine this race will be perfect!




3:10 Fernando:No power!"
923,BlaZeY22 I
924,Yes it is very upsetting for me.
925,Oh im not someone who comments about driver impersonaters
926,Where is Hülkenbergs move around the outside of Ocon on the first lap?
927,Scuderia Ferrari are the Real Madrid of F1! 16 constructors championships and 12 Champions League titles!
928,Was that Woody Harrelson?
929,GP2 Engine.. GP2... ARGH
930,"As almost nobody knows, Kvyat had the same driving coach in his youth as Pastor Maldonado had"
931,They never came back with complaints so he must be doing something right!
932,AffenSindCoolxD Did this driving instructor used to teach Japanese pilots during the war?
933,Really felt bad for Kimi :(
934,Same
935,"+Salty Bicuits    C'mon.....  Hamilton was just coasting,  he'd have an answer on Kimi's pace. Raikkönen was a very slow overtaker last season."
936,"Firemarioflower Oh but he was, before the puncture xD"
937,"+MNM   Dream on,  that slowpoke would have NEVER caught Lewis."
938,Kimi got worse because he would of been P2 or even P1 if he was fast enough and if he was P1 he would of won a grand Prix and he would be happy. And the last time he won a grand Prix was in 2013 so there be happy for Kimi. Bethel has won lots of grand Prix so I felt very bad for Kimi.
939,i love F1

Now, I have 5 great idols in my life:
1. Bill Gates (computing).
2. You (sports).
3. Hafiz Hamidun (music).
4. Syamsul Yusof (filming).
5. Ustaz Don (religion)."
997,Lewis Hamilton i Hope that you're going to be WDC bro :D
998,Oggi93 I'll be WDC 2017💪🏾💪🏾
999,I know i just think its funny :D
1000,They are all fake accounts to impersonate the drivers
1001,Don't let the fact that Vettel finished 7th distract you from the fact that Verstappen finished a race
1002,Hulkenberg should of have been driver of the day
1003,Guys imagine how good F1 would be without Mercedes.  for sure much better
1004,Felipe Massa You escaped me this time but I'll get you in Budapest.
1005,"Felipe Massa (Fake), that would have been all drivers going at 30 miles/hour' Fantastico!"
1006,Felipe Massa Without Mercedes you won't have an engine
1007,"Doug T It's the best on the grid, most reliable too"
1008,"JLV Recordings world class engine, lul."
1009,Massive understeer
1010,Hey palmer did okay toda......... Oh..
1011,"Fast, faster, fastest, hamilton"
1012,Firemarioflower I don’t want a argument but your calling us “unlikeable” when openly insulting millions of people! Doesn’t that make you seem more unlikable
1013,"+Entregan  Because he's an unlikeable turd,  like you and all his other fanboys."
1014,Jorn De Monnink fast faster fastest Mercedes

1027,Nico 9138 predicted the future
1028,Saints should have avoided him.
1029,Niclas Schmitt I've said this for ages. It's actually painful to watch him😂
1030,"""My front tyre brake checked me"" - sebastion vettel"
1031,@Originale 21 What success? 😂😂😂😂
1032,"His left front tire did unexpectedly stop moving when he locked it up defending from Bottas, so you could say that it did brake check him..."
1033,"Paulo Monteiro if vettel was treated like any other driver and got DQ'd for hitting another driver on purpose then lewis would be miles behind, dont matter though because its going to make lewis' win even better."
1034,FERRARI ARE THE CHILDREN OF F.I.A! Ur name is very true
1035,FERRARI ARE THE CHILDREN OF F.I.A! Mercedes have the best car and yet Bottleton is still behind in the championship. Easy
1036,"Vettel is now over ping pong, his new favourite game is bumper cars"
1037,"LOL at 2:14, Vettel tried to bump Verstappen off the track. And Verstappen did the exact same thing to Vettel. Guess who's mad. $:13 as well, pushing Bottas off the track."

1044,my personal driver of the day: Max Verstappen
1045,"Car Guy its not 'dangerous' its just that he is very smart to find a way to defend and attack. also, whats wrong with my username? I have the rights to like someone. its people's personal choices you dumbass"
1046,"Look at your username ffs. Verstappen is arrogant and always finds a way to blame other people. Oh and he's driving style is dangerous. Lastly, how the fuck could you even consider him for driver of the day for his pure performance?"
1047,"Car Guy We are not Verstappen fanboys, you are a Verstappen hater"
1048,"Jesus you verstappen fanboys are annoying. If someone was driver of the day, it should be hulkenberg, räikkönen, hamilton or bottas"
1049,"Kamso 
No, in my opinion he was the best driver."
1050,first
1051,Bottas is going to be Champ
1052,Eemeli Akselin Why do you always condemn my favorite driver Hamilton? What's his sins?
1053,"Car Guy i hate Hamilton because I find him to be a phony and an hypocrite. as you can see, I have reasons to hate him, it's not 'automatic' or just because I like Vettel. why are you so mad? I'm sure you have preferences too..."
1054,Why do you hate hamilton? Just because you like vettel a bit more so you automatically have to hate him? I'd get it if you hated verstappen or kvyat
1055,pine pine I hate Lewis too
1056,"mercedes is my favourite team, vettel my favourite driver. also, love bottas and hate hamilton.  let's see what happens."
1057,We Want baku back
1058,"Niclas Schmitt If every race was like Baku we wouldn't appreciate it anymore. Besides, this was objectively a great race."
1059,Niclas Schmitt No!

1064,"Helmut you should be in bed, tomorrow you have a job performance review with torpedo. You know what to do..."
